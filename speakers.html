Elkouss received a double masters degree in electrical engineering from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) and Telecom ParisTech in 2005-2006 and a Ph.D. in computer science in 2011-2012 from UPM. His Ph.D. thesis in classical error correcting codes for the postprocessing of quantum key distribution was awarded the UPM extraordinary dissertation prize.</p>
                        <p>In 2012, he moved to the Universidad Complutense de Madrid to work on quantum Shannon theory and more concretely on capacities of quantum channels. A highlight was the proof that it is necessary to solve an unbounded optimization problem in order to see whether or not a channel has a positive capacity.</p>
                        <p>In 2015, he moved to TU Delft where he was part of the team that performed the first loophole-free Bell experiment. The aim of his group is to develop the tools, such as entanglement purification protocols, novel error correction codes, quantum network protocol benchmarks and quantum network simulators that will enable the implementation of the first quantum networks.</p><a href="#">Read more</a></div>

You are probably carrying around a whole shopping mall in your pocket right now. A shopping mall that never closes. Millions of products right at your fingertips. In this talk we look back at how information technology changed shopping as we know it today. How did we get there? What are the key technologies that facilitate online shops at the scale of, for example, Amazon, Zalando and bol.com? And we believe we are only at the beginning. The best has yet to come. So, we also peek at how upcoming technologies such as machine learning, augmented reality and blockchain will impact your shopping experience of tomorrow.</p><a href="#">Read more</a></div>

                        <p>Universities don't innovate their teaching methods as fast as primary and middle schools do. In this workshop we'll together create a vision for innovative university education. You'll learn that not only technology does the job, but also behavioural change is required in order to change the world.

We hear impressive tales in the media of 3D printed houses, organs and food, meanwhile 3D printing is often touted as the next industrial revolution- but is the hype to be believed? Winand Slingenbergh will share some of his personal experiences in working with the most common type of 3D printers and take a critical look at the current limitations, providing a reality check to the many misconceptions.</p>
                        <p>With a more balanced perspective we can clearly define the use case for the technology and better assess to what extent 3D printing can disrupt current centralized production methodologies. Though many myths surrounding 3D printing will be dispelled, there is still much unexplored potential when it comes to automated production and will end with a view of what ubiquitous 3D printing might mean for the average consumer in the near future.</p><a href="#">Read more</a></div>
